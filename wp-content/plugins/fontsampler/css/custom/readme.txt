Fontsamplers using custom CSS styles will have their stylesheets dynamically
created and stored in this directory. Make sure the directory is writeable by
 the server. Don't overwrite the files stored in here, as they will get
 dynamically overwritten when the Fontsampler gets saved again from the
 admin area.
